# Corner-Detection-Edge-Detection-in-Point-Clouds
To convert point cloud to realistic 3D models I have developed an algorithm to get an overview of wireframe for that point cloud. My work mainly lies on extracting such points from point cloud which would help us in creating a wireframe for our 3D model. 
I have developed two methods for edge detection and corner detection.

## Edge Detection
